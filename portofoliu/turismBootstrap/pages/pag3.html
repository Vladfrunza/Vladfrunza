                <p class="card-body">It is said that the toponym "Cotnari" comes from an old handicraft, the construction of the barells: "cot" (Romanian word) = "ell" an old unit of measurement = approx. 0.60 m; "ar"  a suffix for the nouns indicating an occupation in the word "cotinar" = the handicraftsman of the barells. Another interpretation is that "Cotnari", as a toponym, refers to the inhabitants (cotunari/catunari) of a very limited rural area, a "hamlet" = "cotun"/"catun". (cf. Vladimir Palamariu, "The oiconyms from Moldavia", 2002). </p>

Its origins lie in a wooden church, built in 1603, by a ruler of Moldavia, Ieremia Movilă. The plan of the church was initially similar to the one of the Dragomirna Monastery, but the final result is much different than the original.

                        The monastic complex was included in 2004 on the list of the historical monuments in Iasi county and it consists of the following: the church, the cells, the ruins of Lady Dafina Dabija's palace, the gate tower and the interior wall.
                        
                        Inside, on the right wall there are two tombstones: the one belonging to the Dabija ruler, beheaded in 1666, in Istambul and another one, of his daughter, Maria, who died at the age of 15.
